## Hello, I'm Lucas !! :wave:


I'm a web developer passionate about the whole world of code. I am always looking for a way to improve my knowledge, trying to reach the next level. 

I started this journey in the first half of 2021 and I'm currently studying Web Full-Stack Development. The scholarship I got is focused in Angular and Java but my thirst for knowledge can't be quenched so I'm able to learn another languages if I need ! :rocket:
